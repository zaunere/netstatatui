# Network Monitor TUI netstat Wrapper

## GENERATED BY manus

A real-time terminal user interface (TUI) application for monitoring network connections, similar to `netstat -alp` but with a modern, interactive interface.

## Features

- **Dual-panel layout**: 
  - Top panel: Listening ports/services (shows only local addresses)
  - Bottom panel: Active connections (shows local, remote addresses and states)
- **Real-time updates**: Network connections are refreshed every second
- **Color-coded states**: Different connection states are highlighted with colors
  - Green: LISTEN (listening sockets)
  - Cyan: ESTABLISHED (active connections)
  - Yellow: TIME_WAIT (connections in time-wait state)
  - Red: CLOSE_WAIT (connections waiting to close)
- **Process information**: Shows PID and process name for each connection
- **Clean interface**: Organized table layout with clear column headers

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run in development mode
cargo run

# Or run the optimized release binary
./target/release/netmon-tui
```

### Controls

- **q** or **Esc**: Quit the application

### Display Panels

**Top Panel - Listening Ports:**
1. **Proto**: Protocol type (TCP, TCP6, UDP, UDP6)
2. **Local Address**: Local IP address and port
3. **PID/Program**: Process ID and name using the port

**Bottom Panel - Active Connections:**
1. **Proto**: Protocol type (TCP, TCP6, UDP, UDP6)
2. **Local Address**: Local IP address and port
3. **Foreign Address**: Remote IP address and port
4. **State**: Connection state (ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT, etc.)
5. **PID/Program**: Process ID and name using the connection

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (installed via rustup)
- Linux system (uses /proc/net/* files)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release
```

## Dependencies

- **ratatui**: Terminal UI framework
- **crossterm**: Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- **tokio**: Async runtime for smooth updates
- **anyhow**: Error handling

## Technical Details

The application parses network information directly from Linux's `/proc/net/` filesystem:
- `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6` for TCP connections
- `/proc/net/udp` and `/proc/net/udp6` for UDP sockets

Process information is resolved by matching socket inodes from `/proc/[pid]/fd/` entries.
